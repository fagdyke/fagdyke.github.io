  <body>it’s hot to be gay. what is it to be hot? to be hot is to be gay, to be gay is to be hot. queers. faggots. dykes. trannies. just ways to call us hot. we’re hot because we’re desirable. to each other. to the world also, but that desire is hidden. it’s forbidden, behind the closed doors of brothels and pornhub. a desire for the taboo. they don’t desire us because it’s taboo - or maybe they do. i have no glimpse into their eye. i know as much of what it is to be cis as i know of what it is to be a tree. they want to fuck us though. they all do. and some of them admit it, but most only to those they trust. they pick the most acceptable of us to want to fuck, the lesbians, and yet still hide it behind some veneer of a fetish, some forbidden voyeurism. it’s hot to watch us fuck. and maybe it’s hot to turn one of them, to fix one of them with the strength of their cock. they think. they say, or it’s implied that’s why they find us hot in the standard cisfeminist worldview of the male gaze as cast upon the dyke. i don’t know. i don’t know what it is to be them, as little as they know what it is to be us. but the lens of desire goes only one way. we may desire individuals picked from their pack but we do not will not shall not ever desire the group. we’re hot and we suffer from it. not hot as the opposite of ugly but rather the unified middle of the sexual oppression of the median cissy cast upon us. we’re all ugly. we fail by their standards of beauty for those standards were created for them to judge one another and not us. to judge themselves, to rank themselves, between each other in some primal drive for competition. a drive that hurts them and locks them in a prison they desire to be free from. the escape is transsexuality. the faggots and the dykes on the outside are at once beautiful and ugly. we cut and colour our hair (or don’t). we mutilate our bodies, inject ourselves with chemicals. we shave only when we’re not supposed to. we transgress and destroy the high concrete walls topped with razor wire. they look out and want us. they want to smuggle us in, out of sight of the guards, to fuck us. they don’t realise the only guards are themselves, each trying to lock each other in out of envy for the free. and when we try and escape they try and hurt us. and sometimes they succeed. and yet we leave the same. for we can live free on the other side of the wall. we watch them watch us as we drink and dance and fuck and we pity them. we love them but we cannot free them until they want to be free. but we can free ourselves and love each other. and we can love ourselves. we see the beauty in the faggot, in the dyke, in the tranny. we see it and we love it openly. we admire it and yes we fuck it, but we love it for it is the beauty in all of us, the beauty we can only make for ourselves. the beauty in the fagdyke is the beauty of loving oneself totally. it’s hot to be gay</body>
