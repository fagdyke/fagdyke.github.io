  <body>it’s <span class="test">hot</span> to be <span class="test">gay</span>. what is it to be <span class="test">hot</span>? to be <span class="test">hot</span> is to be <span class="test">gay</span>, to be <span class="test">gay</span> is to be <span class="test">hot</span>. <span class="test">queers</span>. <span class="test">faggots</span>. <span class="test">dykes</span>. <span class="test">trannies</span>. just ways to call us <span class="test">hot</span>. we’re <span class="test">hot</span> because we’re <span class="test">desirable</span>. to each other. to the world also, but that <span class="test">desire</span> is hidden. it’s <span class="test">forbidden</span>, behind the closed doors of <span class="test">brothels</span> and <span class="test">pornhub</span>. a <span class="test">desire</span> for the <span class="test">taboo</span>. they don’t <span class="test">desire</span> us because it’s <span class="test">taboo</span> - or maybe they do. i have no knowledge of their soul. i know as much of what it is to be cis as i know of what it is to be a tree. they want to <span class="test">fuck</span> us though. they all do. and some of them admit it, but most only to those they trust. they pick the most acceptable of us to want to <span class="test">fuck</span>, the <span class="test">lesbians</span>, and yet still hide it behind some veneer of a <span class="test">fetish</span>, some <span class="test">forbidden voyeurism</span>. it’s <span class="test">hot</span> to watch us <span class="test">fuck</span>. and maybe it’s <span class="test">hot</span> to turn one of them, to fix one of them with the strength of their <span class="test">cock</span>. they think. they say, or it’s implied that’s why they find us <span class="test">hot</span> in the standard cisfeminist worldview of the male gaze as cast upon the <span class="test">dyke</span>. i don’t know. i don’t know what it is to be them, as little as they know what it is to be us. but the lens of <span class="test">desire</span> goes only one way. we may <span class="test">desir</span>e individuals picked from their pack but we do not will not shall not ever <span class="test">desire</span> the group. we’re <span class="test">hot</span> and we suffer from it. not <span class="test">hot</span> as the opposite of <span class="test">ugly</span> but rather the unified middle of the sexual oppression of the median cissy cast upon us. we’re all <span class="test">ugly</span>. we fail by their standards of <span class="test">beauty</span> for those standards were created by them for them to judge one another and not for us. to judge themselves, to rank themselves, between each other in some primal drive for <span class="test">competition</span>. a drive that hurts them and locks them in a prison they <span class="test">desire</span> to be free from. the escape is <span class="test">transsexuality</span>. the <span class="test">faggots</span> and the <span class="test">dykes</span> on the outside are at once <span class="test">beautiful</span> and <span class="test">ugly</span>. we cut and colour our hair (or don’t). we mutilate our bodies, inject ourselves with chemicals. we shave only when we’re not supposed to. we transgress and destroy the high concrete walls topped with razor wire. they look out and want us. they want to smuggle us in, out of sight of the guards, to <span class="test">fuck</span> us. they don’t realise the only guards are themselves, each trying to lock each other in out of envy for the free. and when we try and escape they try and hurt us. and sometimes they succeed. and yet we leave the same. for we can live free on the other side of the wall. we watch them watch us as we <span class="test">drink</span> and <span class="test">dance</span> and <span class="test">fuck</span> and we pity them. we <span class="test">love</span> them but we cannot free them until they want to be free. but we can free ourselves and <span class="test">love</span> each other. and we can <span class="test">love</span> ourselves. we see the <span class="test">beauty</span> in the <span class="test">faggot</span>, in the <span class="test">dyke</span>, in the <span class="test">tranny</span>. we see it and we <span class="test">love</span> it openly. we admire it and yes we <span class="test">fuck</span> it, but we <span class="test">love</span> it for it is the <span class="test">beauty</span> in all of us, the <span class="test">beauty</span> we can only make for ourselves. the <span class="test">beauty</span> in the <span class="test">fagdyke</span> is the <span class="test">beauty</span> of <span class="test">loving</span> oneself totally. it’s <span class="test">hot</span> to be <span class="test">gay</span></body>
